# MIPT2023_NeuralNetworks Course ðŸŒµ

## Course agenda

Course is deligted to introduction in advanced classical machine learning.

Represented themes:
- model ensemble: random forest and boostings
- computer vision CNN
- RNN time series prediction

Despite simplicity cource can be helpful for refreshing and empowering knowledge in using everyday tools.

### Repo sturcturing
